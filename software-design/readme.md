## UI - Architecture
1. [Creating composite UI based on microservices](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/microservices/architect-microservice-container-applications/microservice-based-composite-ui-shape-layout)
>a more advanced approach, called micro frontends, is to design your application UI based on microservices as well. That means having a composite UI produced by the microservices, instead of having microservices on the server and just a monolithic client app consuming the microservices.
